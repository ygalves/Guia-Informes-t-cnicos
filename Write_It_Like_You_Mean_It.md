# Write It Like You Mean It
### A Human-Centered Survival Guide to Technical Reports That Actually Get Read (and Maybe Even Liked)

> Another technical report? Make yours worth reading‚Äîand maybe even appreciated.

## Summary
In many workplaces, technical reports are treated more like a formality than a powerful communication tool...

## The Purpose of a Report: Beyond Just Informing
Before writing a single word, ask yourself: What do I want this report to achieve?

## Know Your Audience
Adapt your message. Use examples. Be clear. Don‚Äôt be afraid to explain the obvious...

## Basic Structure (With Room to Breathe)
- Executive summary
- Context and background
- Key data and evidence
- Interpretation / analysis
- Recommendations
- Attachments

## Humanize Your Content Without Losing Accuracy
You don‚Äôt have to sound like a robot to sound professional...

## Visuals That Speak
A good table can save paragraphs. A clear chart says more than lines of text...

## A Closing That Leaves a Mark
Mention contributors, be clear and trigger action.

## Best Practices and Common Mistakes
- Writing without knowing the audience
- Copy-pasting without adapting
- Sending without checking spelling
- File names like ‚Äúfinal_v4_def_FINAL(1).xlsx‚Äù
- Forgetting dates
- Overloading with data
- Leaving out key recipients
- BCC'ing your boss to "prove you're working"

## When Too Much Info Becomes the Problem
Example: Summarize 40 pages into key figures + attachments. Clarity first.

## Emotional and Technical Checklist Before Sending
- Am I calm or reacting emotionally?
- Is this clear or am I just venting?
- Are the right people on the email?
- Could this report cause issues if leaked?
- Have I reviewed the full document?

## What If No One Acts on My Report?
Follow-up once or twice. Then escalate if needed. If it's minor‚Äîlet it go.

## Using AI to Help You
Use AI as a co-pilot. Don‚Äôt feed it confidential data. Your judgment leads.

## Traceability Also Communicates
Reports with raw data help others recreate the scene. Transparency is key.

## Make It a Habit
Practice with everyday reports to improve for the critical ones.
